        <p class="info1">Optical fibre is the technology associated with data transmission using light pulses travelling along with a long fibre which is usually made of plastic or glass. Metal wires are preferred for transmission in optical fibre communication as signals travel with fewer damages. Optical fibres are also unaffected by electromagnetic interference. The fibre optical cable uses the application of total internal reflection of light. The fibres are designed such that they facilitate the propagation of light along with the optical fibre depending on the requirement of power and distance of transmission. Single-mode fibre is used for long-distance transmission, while multimode fibre is used for shorter distances. The outer cladding of these fibres needs better protection than metal wires.</p>

        <div><p class="for">NA = Sin(θ)</p></div>
        <p class="info3">Here NA is the Numerical Apperture<br>And for calculating we need diameter of the you need to find spot diameter(d) and distance of the spot form the source(f)<br><br>
        tan(θ) = (d/2f)<br>
        θ = tan inverse of (d/2f)</p><br><br>
